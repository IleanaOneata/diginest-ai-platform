      },
      {
        "question": "Will AI agents replace employees?",

        "question": "What systems can be integrated with AI agents?",

        {
          "question": "Does the AI agent understand and speak Romanian?",
          "answer": "Yes. Our agents are specifically trained for the Romanian language, with natural pronunciation and understanding of regional expressions. They also support English for international customers. Conversations sound natural, not robotic."

        {
          "question": "What systems does the AI agent integrate with?",
          "answer": "It integrates with CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.), Google Calendar, Outlook, WhatsApp Business API, existing phone systems and your proprietary software via API. You don't need to change any current tools."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will the AI agent replace my employees?",
          "answer": "No. The AI agent handles repetitive calls and messages (directions, hours, appointment confirmations) so your team can focus on complex, high-value interactions. Most of our clients keep the same staff, but productivity increases by 40-60%."

        {
          "question": "What happens when the AI doesn't know the answer?",
          "answer": "Instant transfer to a team member in under 2 seconds. The AI collects context before transferring so the customer never has to repeat themselves. You set the escalation rules."

          "question": "How long until the AI agent is operational?",

          "question": "Does the AI agent work for my type of business?",
