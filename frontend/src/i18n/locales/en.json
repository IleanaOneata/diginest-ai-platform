      {
        "question": "Will AI agents replace employees?",

        "question": "What systems can be integrated with AI agents?",

          "question": "What processes can be automated with AI?",
          "answer": "Any repetitive, rule-based process: document processing, customer communication, approvals, reporting, onboarding and monitoring. If your team repeats the same actions daily, there's a good chance the process can be automated."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will AI replace my employees?",
          "answer": "No. The purpose of automation is to eliminate repetitive tasks that consume time, not to replace people. Your employees will be freed to focus on strategic, creative and relational activities that require human judgment."

          "question": "What ROI can I expect from automation?",
          "answer": "Our clients see an average 60-80% reduction in time spent on automated processes and near-complete elimination of errors. Positive ROI typically appears within the first 3 months, with savings growing as new processes are added."

        {
          "question": "Does the AI agent understand and speak Romanian?",

          "question": "What systems does the AI agent integrate with?",
