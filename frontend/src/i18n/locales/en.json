      {
        "question": "What are AI agents?",
        "answer": "AI agents are intelligent software programs that can autonomously perform complex tasks. Unlike simple rule-based automations, AI agents can make decisions, learn from experience, and adapt to new situations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to implement an AI agent?",
        "answer": "Implementation takes between 2-8 weeks depending on the complexity of the automated process and required integrations. We start with a functional MVP and iterate based on feedback."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will AI agents replace employees?",
        "answer": "No. AI agents take over repetitive and time-consuming tasks, allowing your team to focus on strategic and creative activities that require human judgment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What systems can be integrated with AI agents?",
        "answer": "Our agents integrate with most popular systems: CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot), ERP (SAP, Odoo), ticketing systems, email, chat platforms, and many more."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the costs?",
        "answer": "Costs depend on the solution's complexity. We offer free consultation to assess needs and propose a solution with transparent budget. Typical ROI is 3-6 months."
